# Question 1 [8 points]

You are part of a team developing a mobile app using Scrum.

At the last sprint planning, you were assigned the task of adding a new authentication method.
However, a customer representative just sent you an email: the representative believes authentication
is less important than support for right-to-left languages, and would like you to work on that instead.
Explain in 1 sentence what you should do:

> Keep working on the existing task, as the sprint backlog is already set, but forward the request to the Product Owner to be added and prioritized into the product backlog.

One of your colleagues, who was tasked with adding a “dark mode” to the app, has found an unrelated bug during testing:
a race condition occasionally causes stale data to be displayed. Your colleague wants to immediately fix it,
though the source of the bug is not clear and it is unknown how often this actually occurs.
Explain in 1 sentence whether that is a good idea and why or why not.

> No, the coworker already has tasks for this sprint and it is the Product Owner that should decide of the bug's priority in the backlog for future sprints.
