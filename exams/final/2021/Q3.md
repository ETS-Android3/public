# Question 3 [18 points]

One of your colleagues has recently taken over responsibility for a legacy codebase, a library currently used by some of your customers.
Before making functional changes, your colleague found a bug caused by incorrect use of the following method in the codebase:

```java
public class User {
    /** Indicates whether the user’s browser, if any, has JavaScript enabled. */
    public boolean hasJavascriptEnabled() { … }

    // … other methods, such as getName(), getAge(), ...
}
```

Your colleague believes that this is a bad API. Explain in 1 sentence why that is indeed the case.

> ???

You are reviewing the pull request your colleague made to fix this bug. Part of the pull request deletes the `hasJavascriptEnabled` method from the code, but you disagree.
Explain in 1 sentence why this could cause issues and what should be done instead.

> ???

The rest of the pull request fixes the bug by rewriting the method that called `hasJavascriptEnabled` to no longer need it.
Explain in 1 sentence what else the pull request should contain and why.

> ???

After some discussion and additional commits to address feedback, the pull request is ready.
You can either “squash” the pull request into a single commit, or leave the multiple commits as they are.
Explain in 1 sentence whether you should “squash” and why.

> ???
