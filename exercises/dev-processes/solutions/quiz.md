Why do large software projects tend to miss their planned budgets and deadlines more often than small projects?

- [ ] There usually aren't enough people working on the project
- [ ] There are not enough managers in the project
- [x] The management task is more difficult and prone to wrong decisions as the project gets bigger
- [ ] Teams fail to account for the fact that debugging takes 50% of the development cycle

> As projects get bigger, managing the development team becomes more complex, and this causes it to miss deadlines and implement the wrong functionality.

Which tools can help you better manage a software project?

- [x] The GitHub issue tracker
- [x] A code review tool, even as basic as GitHub's comment feature
- [x] The Emma code coverage measurement tool
- [x] Git commit messages
- [x] CheckStyle

> All of these are useful. Use the issue tracker for making a plan, for doing code reviews, measuring testing efficiency, documenting your code, and adopting a coding standard

For which of the following scenarios is the Waterfall model most appropriate?

- [ ] While working with the Junior Entreprise EPFL, a talented web developer has to work on a new project with a client who wants a website for his company. This is the client's first website and they are not familiar with web technology. However, the client is enthusiastic and has lots of different ideas about how to organize the website.
- [x] The Volare Space Robotics Challenge was a contest organized by the ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana) and ESA (European Space Agency). The goal was to make high-school students design robots that unload cargo from ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle, while avoiding objects.
- [ ] An EPFL graduate has been employed by a start-up as a software engineer, to work with a team of 10 people (electrical engineers, computer scientists and mechanical engineers). The start-up is developing a new robot that should revolutionize industrial manufacturing. The product is based on an entire suite of technical innovations in AI, motor control, computer vision and materials.
- [ ] The SBB/CFF wants an external software company to develop a brand new app for smartphones. The app should replace most of the services offered by SBB customer service assistants at rail stations. All initial requirements for the app have been written down. However, there are some features that are not covered by the current requirements, but SBB might like to add to a future version of the application.

> An automated robot that operates in space is a very complex product. The requirements of the project are proposed early on and are stable. Since space exploration is governed by many laws, the project is subjected to different stages of approval at each step. The students are inexperienced. All these properties make the Waterfall model suitable for the project.  
> The waterfall model is not suitable for the website project, since the requirements are not clear upfront. The client does not know the possibilities offered by web technologies, therefore cannot produce a detailed statement of what they want.  
> The waterfall model is not suitable for the start-up project, because the waterfall model does not adapt well to changes; the start-up works with new, immature technologies that are unpredictable and can lead to changes in the requirements.  
> The waterfall model is not suitable for the SBB app project, because the requirements can change later on.

> Changes to the Product Backlog are to be discussed between the developers and the Product Owner during the Sprint Planning Meeting and Sprint Review.

Which meeting is held for the sake of the product?

- [ ] daily scrum
- [x] sprint review
- [ ] retrospective

Who is *not* a part of the Scrum Team?
- [x] Project Manager

Who should speak during the Daily Scrum?
- [x] Development Team
- [ ] Product Owner
- [ ] Scrum Master
