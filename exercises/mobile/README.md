# Mobile platform architecture

In this exercise set, you will apply some of the concepts introduced in the course in an Android environment. This is a very realistic environment in which to apply your new knowledge (as it's used a lot to develop real software shipped to real users). It is also the environment in which you will develop next semester in the SDP (Software Development Project) course.

> :warning:  These exercises are optional, and you do not need to solve them all. They are here just to help you gain practice with the areas that you feel less comfortable with.
